# A guide to the GFX HAT


This reference is mostly for reminding me of what I've learnt about the GFX HAT when I inevitably come back to it and have no idea how I got it to work.

# Introduction

The GFX HAT is Pimoroni's updated version of the venerable Display-O-Tron 3000, and brings a 128x64 graphic LCD, 6-section RGB backlight and 6 capacitive touch buttons with their own individual white LEDs.  It's more complex to use than the DoT3K HAT, but is also significantly more flexible.  

Controlling the GFX HAT is split into three different sections:  one module for the LCD, one for the RGB backlight and one for the capacitive touch buttons and their LEDs.  The Pimoroni function reference can be found [here](http://docs.pimoroni.com/gfxhat/), and this is mostly an explaination/worked example of this, plus some information on how to design images to show on the matrix.

I've split each of the major sections into its own sheet, mostly because it was getting unwieldy, and also because I'm expecting the final section about drawing on the LCD to be massive.

Current state:  RBG backlight done, working on the touchpad stuff.  LCD material to follow.
